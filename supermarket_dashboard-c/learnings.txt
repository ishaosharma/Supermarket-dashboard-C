NumPy: Data manipulation
Matplotlib: Creating charts and visualizations
Streamlit: Building web dashboards
MVT Architecture: Organizing code professionally
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values
Data Analysis: Calculating insights from raw data



MVT stands for:
Model: Handles data (loading CSV, cleaning, calculations)
View: Business logic (what to show, how to process)
Template: UI (Streamlit interface that users see)

Think of it like a restaurant:
Model = Kitchen (prepares food/data)
View = Waiter (decides what to serve)
Template = Dining area (where customers eat/see results)


What each library does:

numpy: Fast math operations on arrays
matplotlib: Creating charts (bar, line, pie)
streamlit: Building web interface



🎯 What We Can Analyze From Your Dataset
Looking at your supermarket data, we can show:

Sales Over Time - Which months had most sales?
Branch Performance - Which branch (A, B, C) sells most?
Product Line Analysis - Which products are popular?
Customer Type - Members vs Normal customers
Payment Methods - Cash, Ewallet, Credit card usage
Gender Analysis - Male vs Female shopping patterns
City Comparison - Yangon, Mandalay, Naypyitaw
Rating Distribution - Customer satisfaction



model.py - Handles data
view.py - Processes data
template.py - Shows dashboard
app.py - Main program
